-Please Note: This program was developed in the C++ language<br/>

# HOW TO RUN PROGRAM
NOTE: This program will calculate ALL possible outputs from the given power and limit, near miss values are then sorted by <strong>Relative Miss Ratio</strong>
 and the lowest relative miss ratio will be printed at the bottom of the screen (#1 = lowest relative miss ratio)<br/>
 
-To run program, open the 'Program .EXE' folder<br/>
-Run the FermantLastTheoremNearMissCalculator.exe program<br/>
-Upon running the program, you will be greeted with the Near Miss Calculator which will ask for user input<br/>
-Please note: Constraints are as follows:<br/>
   -“N” cannot be less than 3 or greater than 12.<br/>
   -The limit cannot be greater than 100 (memory purposes)<br/>
-Input value for “N” and the limit of calculations<br/>
-The program will execute and show the smallest possible miss at the bottom of the screen thus ending the program<br/>
-Press any button and you should be greeted by the main screen again<br/>
